%%This is on how to do fuzzy c-means clustering on inttermittent demand in Matlab

m=xlsread('Intermittent Demand.xls')   %% we must make sure that the excel file is editable
x=m(1,1:end)
[c,u,mad]=fcm(x',6)                    %% 6 is the number of clustering center.
                                       %% every row represents a data point
                                    
%%c is the center, u is the membership matrix
%%Next step is to fuzzify the dataset
m=[]
z=[]

for i=1:size(u,2)
    for j=1:length(c)
        if u(j,i)==max(u(1:end,i))
           m=m[m,j];break
        end
    end
z=[z,c(j)]
end

%%
MSE=dot(x-z,x-z)
TSS=dot(x-mean(x),x-mean(x))
R-square=1-MSE/TSS

%% The R squre here is just the measure of the accuracy for the fuzzification, rather than the "FORECASTING"
