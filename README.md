Intermittent-Demand
===================
These are codes which need to be repeatedly used in my research project. Different scripts perform different functions. 


The problem is that these codes are not inter linked.  

Matlab Code 1. Croston's Method (function, forecasting)
            2. greyprediction (function forecasting)
            3. Fuzy clustering method (script data)
            
R code: 
            1. ARIMA (script forecasting)
            2. classificatio (function forecasing, pattern classification)
            3. FCM (script fuzzy clustering)
            4. MSE (script MSE calculation)
